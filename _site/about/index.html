I am Head Nerd (CTO) and co-founder at <a href="https://meiro.io?utm_campaign=v_blog">Meiro</a>, based in Brno, Czech Republic. I started Brave New Obvious as a way to document all the small victories and big facepalms I experience each day building a data product. You can find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/kurkavojtech">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/kurka.vojtech/">Facebook</a>.</p> <h2>Why the name?</h2> <p>Because I always have this rollecrcoaster of feelings while programming/debugging/optimizing.</p> <p>First, it is excitement, approaching a new problem. I feel brave, exploring new waters.</p> <p>Then, a few roadbumps. Well, not a few, but quite a lot.</p> <p>In the end a victory - something I have built is working.</p> <p>But more often it feels like the solution was obvious from the start. That I should have seen it and apply it rightaway, that I haven’t done my homework properly.</p> <p>But is it really the case? There is this czech saying: “After a battle, everyone is a general.” The solution in hindsight looks straightforward, obvious. But was it really from the start, before I jumped through all the loops, made numerous iterations?</p> <p>This is where you come in.</p> <h2>I need your help to decide if the solution was obvious or not</h2> <p>In this blog I am describing my learnings, solutions to the problems, tips and hints. Hacks, proper solutions, best practices, but also mistakes I made. And I would be glad if you could learn from my mistakes rather then you do them on your own.</p> <p>I would like to know if the content I share to you is valuable, something that helped you make your project better, more capable, faster. I would like to know you learned something new that you can use in your life.</p> <p>You can let me know exactly that by buying me a coffee, or sending me a piece of crypto.</p> <p><a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/bravenewobvious" target="_blank"><img src="https://cdn.buymeacoffee.com/buttons/v2/default-blue.png" alt="Buy Me A Coffee" style="height: 60px !important;width: 217px !important;" /></a></p> <p>or send a piece of crypto my way to</p> <ul> <li>BTC: <strong>bc1q2r9rtdpuuf3uwckns8rxeaqpxeyl34jx6a26ez</strong></li> <li>ETH: <strong>0x266F13A463D17F19CB2e2a4CE93B6e40D6F6A3e1</strong></li> <li>LTC: <strong>MCwNDN9Jtj7NDfqBfhU68gyeCZtP5qVjDK</strong></li> </ul> <p>If you do that, it tells me two things:</p> <ol> <li>The content I create has a value to someone else than me.</li> <li>Because it has a value to someone else, I should continue to do it.</li> </ol> <p>And I really love to share knowledge. Please, keep me motivated :))</p> <p><strong>Thank you!</strong></p> </div> </article> <footer class="site-footer"> <div class="container"> <small class="block">&copy; 2021 Vojtech V Kurka &middot; &lt;/&gt; Powered by <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and <a href="https://github.com/heiswayi/thinkspace">Thinkspace theme</a></small> </div> </footer> </main> </body> </html>
