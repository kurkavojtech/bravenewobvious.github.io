## What is a query and what is an execution plan?



<h2>I need your help to decide if the solution was obvious or not</h2>

In this blog I am describing my learnings, solutions to the problems, tips and hints. Hacks, proper solutions, best practices, but also mistakes I made. And I would be glad if you could learn from my mistakes rather then you do them on your own.

I would like to know if the content I share to you is valuable, something that helped you make your project better, more capable, faster. I would like to know you learned something new that you can use in your life.

You can let me know exactly that by buying me a coffee, or sending me a piece of crypto.

or send a piece of crypto my way to

* BTC: **bc1q2r9rtdpuuf3uwckns8rxeaqpxeyl34jx6a26ez**
* ETH: **0x266F13A463D17F19CB2e2a4CE93B6e40D6F6A3e1**
* LTC: **MCwNDN9Jtj7NDfqBfhU68gyeCZtP5qVjDK**

If you do that, it tells me two things:
1. The content I create has a value to someone else than me.
2. Because it has a value to someone else, I should continue to do it.

And I really love to share knowledge. Please, keep me motivated :))

**Thank you!**
